## GB/GBC emulator

this thing aint workin yet, yo.

If you want to compile it to see how far along it is, you'll need to have a working C compiler, libc, binutils, and at present, the IUP toolkit and its development files. With all this supplied, you should be able simply enter the directory containing all the source files and simply type

    make

If this software does not compile under the standards-compliant compiler and libc of your choice, please file an issue - this is considered a bug.

Additional user interface options are intended as a possibility in the future, including a set of null-driver modules that should compile on any platform, to aid in porting.
